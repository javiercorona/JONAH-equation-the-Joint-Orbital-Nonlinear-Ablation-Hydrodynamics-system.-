Meteor Dynamics
This model is a system of first-order Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) ready for numerical integration, and it describes how the meteor's position, velocity, spin, mass, and shape evolve over time.
1. State Vector
The complete state of the meteor at any time t is defined by the following vector:
 * \mathbf{r}(t): Position vector (3 components: x, y, z).
 * \mathbf{v}(t): Linear velocity vector (3 components: \dot{x}, \dot{y}, \dot{z}).
 * \omega(t): Angular spin rate (scalar, assuming rotation about a principal axis).
 * m(t): Total mass of the meteor (scalar).
 * I(t): Moment of inertia about the axis of rotation (scalar).
2. Time Derivatives (Coupled Differential Equations)
The derivative of the state vector defines the rate of change for each variable:
| Derivative | Description |
|---|---|
| \dot{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{v}(t) | Rate of change of Position is the linear velocity. |
| \dot{\mathbf{v}} = \mathbf{a}_{net} | Rate of change of Velocity is the net linear acceleration from all forces (gravity, drag, and thrust/recoil from mass loss). |
| \dot{\omega} | Rate of change of Angular Spin (Angular Acceleration). Derived from the Angular Momentum Balance (\tau = I\dot{\omega} + \omega \dot{I}). \tau_{net} is the net torque, and the second term accounts for the change in the moment of inertia. |
| \dot{m} | Rate of change of Mass (Mass loss). It is the negative of the mass shedding rate \dot{m}_{shed}, which is a function of Stress (S) and Temperature (T). |
| \dot{I} | Rate of change of Moment of Inertia. It evolves due to the change in mass \dot{m} and any independent change in shape \dot{shape} (e.g., fragmentation). |
3. Auxiliary Definitions (Calculated at each step)
These variables link the state components and define the forces and torques:
| Auxiliary Variable | Equation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Net Torque (\tau_{net}) | \tau_{net} = (1 - C_{geom}) \tau_G M_A - \delta_I | The total rotational force acting on the meteor. It includes a portion of the total available torque \tau_G M_A (modulated by a geometry factor C_{geom}) minus the recoil torque \delta_I. |
| Recoil Term (\delta_I) | \delta_I = \dot{m}_{shed} r_{shed}^2 \omega(t) | The recoil torque generated by the angular momentum carried away by the shed mass \dot{m}_{shed} at a distance r_{shed} from the center. |
| Stress (S) | S = (1 - C_{geom}) \tau_G M_A + \frac{dI}{dt} - \delta_I | The critical internal stress driving fragmentation. It is an algebraically defined variable based on current rotational state and inertial change. |
| Mass Shedding Rate (\dot{m}_{shed}) | \dot{m}_{shed} = g(S, T) | The function g describes how much mass is shed based on the calculated stress S and the current temperature T. |
| Gravitational Accel. (\mathbf{a}_{gravity}) | \mathbf{a}_{gravity} = -\frac{GM}{r^3} \mathbf{r} | Gravitational acceleration where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the central body (e.g., Sun), and r is the distance $ |
| Drag Accel. (\mathbf{a}_{drag}) | $\mathbf{a}{drag} = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\rho{atm} C_D A}{m} | \mathbf{v}_{rel} |
| Rotational Velocity (\mathbf{v}_{rotational}) | \mathbf{v}_{rotational} = R_{eq} \omega(t) \hat{k} | The magnitude of velocity at the equator (R_{eq}) due to spin \omega(t) around the axis vector \hat{k}. This is used to define \mathbf{v}_{rel}. |
